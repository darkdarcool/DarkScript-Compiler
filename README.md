# Darkscript!

DarkScript is a lightweight console based scripting language! Though it is slow, is is very easy to understand and I as slick with the colors as java.

Now, here are a couple tutorials to help you eith your first DarkScript program!

----------------------------
**Logging into the console**
----------------------------

To print things into the console, DarkScript uses two main built-in functions to do so!

Here is the first basic one:

``` js
window.out("Hello World")
```

This then startes the log statment. This creates no new line this is is started. To make a new line, do this:

``` js
window.out.ln("Hello Again")
```

This creates a new line with it finishing the print statment. 

### Tip!
> To make a new line, do a `$n` in any function to make a new line.


Unfortanantly ASNI escape codes don't work in this version of DarkScript. But if you use on of our premade colors, like red, blue, and pink, you can make anything more colorfull. Down below is a list of all of the colors.

**User Input**
--------------

To use user input, you're gonna have to create the variable. To create this variable, you start off with the prefix of `string`. Following that with a space, you can ten come up with a name for your variable! Here is an example:

``` js
string name
```

After your variable is created, you can then use them for user input!!
